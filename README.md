# APs In Pelicans
Templates for cutting cardboard holders for Cisco Wireless Access Points to be stored in Pelican cases.

Right now, the template is designed around holding 10 APs in a particular model of Pelican hard case. It's probably adaptable to other sizes or quantities of APs.

The code partially supports changing paramaters to hold more or less APs. I may clean it up later if the need arrises -- if you modify it, a PR is always welcome.
